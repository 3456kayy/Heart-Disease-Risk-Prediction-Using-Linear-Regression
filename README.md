<h1>Heart Disease Risk Prediction Using Linear Regression</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, a dataset containing information on heart disease, biking, and smoking was analyzed to explore the relationships between these variables. The project began with visualizing the data using scatter plots to identify correlations between biking, smoking, and the risk of heart disease. A linear regression model was then built to predict heart disease risk based on biking and smoking data. The data was split into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R-squared value. These metrics showed that the model was highly effective with predicting, with a high R-squared value and acceptable error margins. Finally, predictions were made for new subjects based on their biking and smoking habits, providing an estimate of their potential heart disease risk.
